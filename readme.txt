Numerical simulation of the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE)

The script sle.py generates chordal SLE traces using the Ninomiya-Victoir scheme with a variable step size.

The code requries the libraries NumPy, Matplotlib, cmath and math.

Three example plots of SLE_k on [0,1] are included (for k = 8/3, k = 4 and k = 6).
